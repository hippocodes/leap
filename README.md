# Front-End Development Test

Given a design, your goal is to build out a semi-functional landing page. The purpose of this assessment is to get an
idea of your abilities, coding style, architecture decisions, and skill level.

[This design in Adobe Xd](https://xd.adobe.com/view/aa6e8b2a-08d0-42a4-bcbd-4822f2e7ea06-ff3d/specs/) should supply you with
 everything you need to accomplish the task.

Constraints/Requirements:
- No frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Tailwind, etc)
- Use semantic HTML and keep SEO and A11y in mind
- The font family used is Helvetica Nueue. Replace this font with a family of your choosing using either a system, Google font, or another source of your liking
- Separate your CSS and HTML by having two files, app.css and index.html
- Use whatever CSS layout methods you like, but newer CSS features are encouraged (Grid, Flexbox)
- The mobile menu does not need to be functional, you only need to ensure it collapses into a hamburger icon
- Initialize a git repository of this project
- Multiple commits are encouraged (opposed to a single "init commit")
- Compress your finished project into a zip file and use WeTransfer to send your code over. Alternatively you could push the code to your Github and share the link.
